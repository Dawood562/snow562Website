# Welcome to my website!
Written in React and using Next.js to export static files, this website has been ported over from the original that was written in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It contains a list of my projects, experience, and some information about me :)

Any comments, suggestions, critiques, etc., just reach out to me or make an issue.

You can visit it at [https://snow562.com](https://www.snow562.com). Have fun!
